        What Drives Me
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-8 text-lg">
        I'm passionate about continuous learning and innovation in software
        development. Whether it's exploring new technologies, optimizing user

      <p className="text-lg">
        When I'm not coding, you can find me spending time with my family,
        playing videos games, watching movies, or camping in the beautiful
        outdoors of northern British Columbia. I believe in balancing work and
        life, and I strive to bring that same balance to the projects I work on.
