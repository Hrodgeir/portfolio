      <p className="mb-8 text-lg">
        Hello! I'm <span className="bold">Matt Hodgson</span>, a Software
        Developer based in Prince George, BC. I specialize in crafting
        intuitive, responsive web applications that deliver impactful user
        experiences.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8 text-lg">
        With a Bachelor of Software Engineering from the University of Victoria,
        I've honed my skills in both frontend and backend development, working

        <span className="bold">My Journey</span>
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-8 text-lg">
        Currently, I serve as a Senior Software Engineer at{" "}
        <span className="bold">xMatters</span>, where I lead frontend
        initiatives, refactor large-scale React components, and collaborate with
        cross-functional teams to enhance our digital operations platform.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8 text-lg">
        Before that, I developed over 20 custom web mapping applications at{" "}
        <span className="bold">VertiGIS</span>, focusing on requirements
        analysis, design, and iterative development. I've also built
        cross-platform mobile apps using Xamarin and ArcGIS .NET Runtime,
        leading several projects to successful, on-budget completion.

      </h3>
      <p className="mb-8 text-lg">
        Whether it's exploring new technologies, optimizing user interfaces, or
        mentoring peers, I thrive on challenges that push the boundaries of
        what's possible in tech.

      <p className="text-lg">
        When I'm not coding, you can find me spending time with my family,
        playing videos games, watching movies, watching hockey, or camping in
        the beautiful outdoors of northern British Columbia. I believe in
        balancing work and life, and I strive to bring that same balance to the
        projects I work on.
